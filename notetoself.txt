"Sorry for keeping you out of the loop. We are working on an login/authentication system for Petflix (we are tring to use AWS Cognito, but we need to do research). We are also looking to make the buttons functional, so they load and play a video when clicked on. We are still trying to figure out how to develop a backend. Any ideas are welcome. Also, for everyone who attended the meeting, if I missed any detail, feel free to provide further elaborations."

I know everyone else can see this commit but I needed to put it somewhere instantly associable with the project
